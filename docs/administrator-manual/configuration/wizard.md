The initial configuration wizard facilitates easy installation and setup of all NethVoice components.

The wizard will guide you through the following sections:
- **Extensions**: Configure user extensions.
- **Trunks**: Set up trunk connections.
- **Routes**: Define call routing rules.
- **Devices**: Manage phone devices and provisioning.

At the end of the wizard:
- each section will be accessible from the main menu for further modifications
- a new [Dashboard](./dashboard) page will be available to monitor system status and performance
- a new [Applications](./applications) section will be available to manage CTI features

## Extensions

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) extensions are virtual phone numbers that let people make and receive calls using the network instead of a traditional phone line. Each extension is a unique number inside your NethVoice system — colleagues can call one another by dialing that number. An extension can also receive external calls once the system’s phone lines are configured.

During the initial setup, assign one extension to each user (we recommend starting from 200). Enter the extension number in the field and click Add to link it to the user.

This will list all users available in the user domain associated with the NethVoice instance.
You can manage users (create, update, reset passwords, delete) by accessing the dedicated section through the button **[Link to the Portal](./install/nethserver.md#user-domains)**.

Enter the corresponding extension for each user:

1. Click the extension input for the selected user and enter a numeric extension (recommended starting at 200). Use digits only — no spaces or punctuation.  
2. Click Add to assign the extension to the user.  
3. On success the user row is highlighted and a green checkmark appears.

Click the **Next** button to proceed to the Trunks section.

## Trunks

Trunks are the connections that allow your PBX to send and receive calls to and from external networks. They act as the bridge between internal extensions and the public telephone network or cloud telephony providers. Trunks can be implemented as cloud-based VoIP lines or as on‑premise physical connections using gateways to interface with the PSTN.

- VoIP trunks (cloud)
  - Hosted by a service provider and delivered over the Internet using SIP/PJSIP.
  - Pros: quick to provision, highly scalable, lower upfront cost, provider-managed redundancy and features (SIP credentials, codecs, encryption).
  - Cons: depends on internet reliability and bandwidth; may require firewall/NAT and QoS configuration.
  - Best when you prefer flexible, cloud-first deployments and rapid scaling.

- Physical trunks (on‑premise via gateway)
  - Use dedicated hardware gateways to connect the PBX to landline services (FXO/PRI/ISDN).
  - Pros: direct PSTN connectivity, often lower latency and predictable behavior, works without Internet dependency, required in some regulated environments.
  - Cons: higher upfront hardware and maintenance cost, model-specific configuration, limited scalability compared to cloud trunks.
  - Best when local telco connectivity, regulatory constraints, or offline resilience are required.

### Add physical lines

To add physical lines, you need to configure a supported SIP gateway. See the [Supported Gateways](./provisioning/supported_gateways) section for a list of compatible devices.

See the [Gateway provisioning](./provisioning/gateway_provisioning) section for detailed instructions on configuring and provisioning your

Once the settings are saved, you can download the configuration file to upload to the device through its interface.

If you do not wish to add physical lines, you can skip this section by clicking the **Next** button to proceed to VoIP trunks.

### Add VoIP trunks

You can create VoIP trunks by selecting one of the supported providers and entering the necessary information.

- **Provider**: Choose the provider to use.
- **Trunk Name**: Specify the name of the trunk.
- **Username**: Username given by the provider.
- **Password**: Password given by the provider.
- **Phone Number**: Phone number given by the provider.
- **Allowed codec**: Permitted codec.
- **Force codec**: Allow only the permitted codec.

Press **Save** to create the configuration for that VoIP trunk.

Finally , click the **Next** button to proceed to the Routes section.

## Routes

Inbound routes define how incoming calls are matched and routed to internal destinations; outbound routes determine how internal calls are sent out through trunks. Save the route to apply changes and start receiving calls according to the configured rules. In the Routes section you can configure both inbound and outbound routes — each type is explained in detail below.

### Inbound

Inbound routes define how incoming calls from trunks are matched and handled before reaching your internal resources. They typically match on the called number (DID/DDI), caller ID, or time conditions and then forward the call to a destination such as an extension, IVR, queue, ring group, or a Visual Plan flow.

Key points:
- Match criteria: DID/DDI patterns, caller ID, and time conditions (most specific matches take precedence).
- Destinations: any internal endpoint or a Visual Plan route that implements call‑handling logic.
- Additional options: number rewriting (called/caller), call blocking/allow lists, and failover behaviors.
- Best practice: test matches with representative numbers and ensure trunks used for matching are enabled and properly ordered.

Click to **Create new route** to open the Visual Plan application, where you can create, modify, and connect components of NethVoice that will handle the call flow for the incoming number.


By clicking the checkmark symbol in the Visual Plan application, the configuration of your route will be saved.
From that moment on, you can receive calls following the configured flow.

### Outbound

Outbound routes determine how outbound calls from your PBX are matched and sent out through available trunks. Think of them as the rules that map an internal dialed number to a trunk (or sequence of trunks) based on patterns, caller ID, time conditions, and other criteria. Properly configured outbound routes ensure calls take the best available path, provide predictable failover, and comply with local dialing plans.

The wizard shows a list of outbound routes. On first use it proposes default routes that cover common dialing plans:

- National: calls within the country
- Cellphone: mobile number calls
- International: calls outside the country
- Toll: toll-free and premium-rate numbers

Matching patterns are already defined for each route.
Inside each route is possibile to add or remove associated trunks.

By pressing **Save** button, the configuration is written to NethVoice and the route becomes active. 

## Devices

Devices are physical (desk) phones that register to the PBX and are associated with users. 

Configure desk phones and their models: add phones by MAC (manual or batch), choose or create models, and adjust provisioning, default settings, and per‑device options.

### Phones

During the wizard you can add phones using one of the following methods:

- Copy a list of MAC addresses from a spreadsheet or text file (batch import).
- Enter MAC address and model manually, one phone at a time.

Select the method you prefer: Manual (single-entry) or Paste from file (batch import).

Batch import format for MAC addresses:
 
- Input: plain text, *one MAC address per line*.
- Accepted separators: `:` or `-` between octets, or no separator at all.
- Valid MAC: exactly 12 hexadecimal characters (6 octets); hex digits are case-insensitive.
- Leading and trailing whitespace on each line is ignored.
- Empty lines are ignored and may be used to separate groups.
- Examples of accepted forms (illustrative): `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`, `aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff`, `aabbccddeeff`.

After entering the MAC address, you can select the phone model. Selecting the exact model is required for the correct configuration of the phone.

:::warning
If the model is not selected or the wrong model is chosen, some phone functions, such as provisioning via RPS or line keys, may not be available.
:::


### Models

The Devices > Models page shows the phone models available in Devices > Phones (built‑in models plus any custom models you create). Use Create new model to base a custom profile on an existing model.

Settings:
- Use **Default Settings** to edit parameters inherited by all models, such as:
  - **Admin Password**: web interface password for administrator user, a random one is generated.
  - **User Password**: web interface password for non‑admin users, a random one is generated.
  - **Phone language**: language setting for the phone.
  - **Tone zone**: audio tone settings for the phone.
  - **Provisioning scheduling**: schedule for automatic provisioning updates.

Saved defaults can be edited later by clicking again **Default Settings** button.

## Configurations

This section configures NethVoice CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) — the web client used by end users to manage calls, presence, contacts, queues and related telephony features. CTI = Computer Telephony Integration.The following subsections explain how to create groups, profiles and permissions that control what features are available in the CTI interface.

### Groups

Groups are named collections of users that simplify management and control inside NethVoice CTI. Use groups to control visibility and permissions across multiple users at once.
CTI groups are different from user domains groups.

Common uses
- Control visibility in the Presence Panel and CTI interfaces (show/hide users by group).
- Enable group-level CDR and queue statistics (Group CDR, Queue Agent/Manager visibility).
- Assign shared features like call pickup, group voicemail or shared operator duties.
- Scope permissions and profiles so settings can be applied to many users simultaneously.

Best practices
- Choose clear, descriptive names (e.g., Sales_North, Support_Level1).
- Create groups first, then assign them to profiles and permissions where required.
- Manage membership from the Users or Groups pages; verify group visibility in the relevant CTI panels.
- Test group behavior with a sample user before wide deployment.

You can create user groups that will be visible and usable in applications such as NethVoice CTI.

To create a group, click **Create new group**, specify a name (and optional description), save, then assign users and enable the group where needed in profiles and CTI settings.

Click **Next** to proceed to the Profiles section.

### Profiles

Profiles define a reusable set of [permissions](#permissions) that act as role templates. Apply a profile to a user to grant a predefined combination of CTI capabilities, routing access, CDR visibility, phone functions and other NethVoice features.

By default three profiles exist:
- `Basic`: minimal access for standard users (calls, voicemail, limited CTI).
- `Standard`: typical user features (presence, address book, basic CTI and forwarding).
- `Advanced`: broad access for power users (advanced CTI, queue/manager views, recording and monitoring).

Creating and managing profiles:
1. Duplicate an existing profile to preserve a baseline.  
2. Provide a clear name and short description.  
3. Enable or disable feature groups (CTI, Address Book, CDR, Presence, Queues, Phone Lines, etc.), set outbound route access, and select visible user groups.  
4. Assign the profile to users on the Users page.

Best practices:
- Keep a small set of well-documented profiles to simplify administration.  
- Use descriptive names (e.g., Sales_Rep, Support_Level1) and record intended usage.  
- Test profile changes on a sample user before broad rollout.  
- Remember to enable access to the user groups previously created on the profiles where necessary.

Then click **Next** to proceed to the Users section.

#### Permissions

Permissions control specific features and capabilities within NethVoice CTI. They are grouped into sections that correspond to different functional areas. When creating or editing a profile, you can enable or disable individual permissions to tailor the user experience.
