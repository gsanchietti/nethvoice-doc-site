### When to Use the Advanced Interface

Access the Advanced interface when you need to:

- Configure advanced FreePBX settings not available in the main NethVoice wizard
- Manage system-level configurations
- Access reporting and monitoring tools
- Perform system maintenance and troubleshooting
- Configure custom extensions and applications

### Best Practices

- Always make a system backup before making advanced configuration changes
- Document any custom configurations you make for future reference
- Test configuration changes in a development environment if possible
- Consult the FreePBX documentation for complex configuration tasks



## Final settings

The wizard is almost complete. You can now configure some final settings before accessing the NethVoice CTI interface:

- **Set system language**: the default is English, but you can change it to your preferred language.
- **Change password**: for security reasons, it is recommended to change the default admin password.
