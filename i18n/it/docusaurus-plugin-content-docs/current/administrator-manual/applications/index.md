# Applications

The *Applications* section allows for the creation, modification, or deletion of certain PBX features, which are initially created and configured in the wizard but subsequently utilized in the NethVoice CTI.

For instance, customer cards are set up in the wizard to access the database and to practically display the obtained information, but the actual usage occurs within the NethVoice CTI, during calls or when searching for specific information.

## Available Applications

The following applications are available in the *Applications* section:

- **Customer Cards**: Display information from external databases during calls.
- **Phonebook Sources**: Integrate external address books for contact resolution.
- **Parameterized URLs**: Trigger custom URLs with call-related parameters during call events.
